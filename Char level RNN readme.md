# char-rnn-tensorflow
Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for character-level language models in Python using Tensorflow.

Inspired from Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tinyshakespeare corpus, run `python train.py`.

To sample from a checkpointed model, `python sample.py`.
# Roadmap
- Add explanatory comments
- Expose more command-line arguments
- Compare accuracy and performance with char-rnn
